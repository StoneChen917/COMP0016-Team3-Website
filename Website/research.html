        <!-- contents -->
        <p align="justify">
            In our research, we considered many concepts including what they are, their different types and why they are the best suited for our project.
            <br>
        </p>

        <b><br>Named Entity Recognition</b>
        <p align="justify">What is Named Entity Recognition?
            <br>Named Entity Recognition is mainly the process of detecting entities from text and classifying them into different categories that we can use.
            <br>
            <br>Different types of NER:
            <br>1. Dictionary-based has a dictionary containing vocabulary which is used. Basic string-matching algorithms check whether the entity is present in the given text against the items in the vocabulary. This method is generally not employed because the dictionary that is used is required to be updated and maintained consistently.
            <br>2. Rule-based has a predefined set of rules for information extraction is used which are pattern-based and context-based. Pattern-based rule uses the morphological pattern of the words while context-based uses the context of the word given in the text document.
            <br>3. Machine learning based solves a lot of limitations of the above two methods. It is a statistical-based model that tries to make a feature-based representation of the observed data. It can recognise an existing entity name even with small spelling variations. The machine learning-based approach involves two phases for doing NER. The first phase trains the ML model on annotated documents. In the next phase, the trained model is used to annotate the raw documents. The process is similar to a normal ML model pipeline.
            <br>4. Deep learning NER is more accurate than the ML-based method because it is capable of assembling words, enabling it to understand the semantic and syntactic relationship between various words better. It is also capable of analysing topic-specific and high-level words automatically.
            <br>
            <br>Why we implemented NER:
            <br>Our client has asked us to prioritise the extraction of information related to Admin 1 and 2 as well as geographical information such as ISO codes so that they can update an already existing database with additional extracted information, therefore we believe the most appropriate approach to go with is NER.

        </p>

        <b><br>SpaCy</b>
        <p align="justify"> What is SpaCy?
            <br>SpaCy is an open-sourced Natural Language Processing library for Python. spaCy is designed to make it easy to build systems for information extraction or general-purpose natural language processing. SpaCy utilises tokens which breaks a text down into its basic units which are then represented in spaCy as Token objects. Tokenization is a process of splitting up text into smaller parts(tokens).
            Tokenisation can be either words, characters or subwords:
            <br>Word tokenization splits text into individual words based on the space.
            <br>Character tokenization splits text into sets of characters. These characters will represent words.
            <br>Subword tokenization splits text into subwords. These subwords can be combined to create whole words.
        </p>

        <b><br>Q&A Model</b>
        <p align="justify">What is QA model?
            <br>Question-Answering models are machine learning tools that can provide answers to given questions once provided some information/ context. It is a form of Natural Language Processing where the computer attempts to “understand” natural language and interpret them.
            <br>
            <br>Different types of QA Model:
            <br>1.Reading Comprehension aims to provide answers to questions through understanding of words and concepts. This is best suited for literary (eg. paper and articles).
            <br>2.Closed book questioning involves a computer learning a set of facts and answering questions based on those facts.
            <br>3.Closed-domain uses questions under a specific domain which limits the questions that can be asked to those in a specific category. 
            <br>4.Open-domain uses a much larger dataset to answer questions, and therefore has a larger scope of questions that can be asked.
            <br>
            <br>Hugging Face:
            <br>Hugging Face is a platform that allows users to shared pre-trained models that can be used for Natural Language Processing. It is popular for its utilisation of the transformer library in Python and its use of models such as BERT and RoBERTa.
            <br> 
            <br>Why we implemented QA model:
            <br>We implemented a QA model because it accurately was able to use keyword matching and information retrieval to answer many of the questions we needed for for our requirements (eg. operation start date, operation end date, glide number, operation budget).
            
            
        </p>

        <b><br>Table Extraction</b>
        <p align="justify">What is Table Extraction?
            <br>Table extraction is a concept that, when implemented, can extract specific data from a table. Certain libraries allow you to convert unstructured data in PDF files to clean, structured data.
            <br>
            <br>What is Camelot?
            <br>Camelot is a Python library that allows you to extract tables from PDFs.
            <br>Why Camelot?
            <br>Configurability: Camelot gives you control over the table extraction process with tweakable settings.
            <br>Metrics: You can discard bad tables based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without having to manually look at each table.
            <br>Output: Each table is extracted into a pandas DataFrame, which seamlessly integrates into ETL and data analysis workflows. You can also export tables to multiple formats, which include CSV, JSON, Excel, HTML, Markdown, and Sqlite.
            <br>
            <br>What is PyPDF2:
            <br>PyPDF2 is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files.
        </p>

        <b><br>String Matching</b>
        <p align="justify">What is String Matching?
            <br>String matching refers to finding occurrence(s) of a pattern string within another string or body of text.
            <br>
            <br>Types of String Matching:
            <br>1.Exact String Matching is to find one, several, or all occurrences of a defined string (pattern) in a large string (text or sequences) such that each matching is perfect.
            <br>2.Approximate String Matching Algorithms (also known as Fuzzy String Searching) searches for substrings of the input string.
            <br>
            <br>Fuzzy matching:
            <br>Fuzzy matching is a method that provides an improved ability to process word-based matching queries to find matching phrases or sentences from a database. When an exact match is not found for a sentence or phrase, fuzzy matching can be applied. This improves accuracy as it can identify false-positives and remove redundancies. 
            <br>
            <br>Cosine Matching:
            <br>Cosine Matching addresses the similarity between two things and assigns it a numeric value of similarity (1 being the most similar and 0 being the least). It can be used when fuzzy matching becomes too probabilistic. In our project this can help when finding the admin codes as cosine similarity can be used on admin 0 codes to reduce the lengthy size of the ISO codes list to make it easier to find admin 1 and 2.
            <br>
            <br>String Matching Comparisons:
            <br>We decided to compare the 3 types of string matching on the basis of time taken to execute the program, the number of ‘Not Found’ values returned as well as the accuracy which was calculated by (number of correct answers / total number of answers) * 100.   
            <br>It was observed that adding the first letter filter did not reduce time of execution significantly except in the case of Cosine Matching. However, the additional filter reduced accuracy in all cases except with Cosine Matching as well as increased the number of ‘Not Found’ values returned from 0 to 1 in all cases. This is because locations have been entered with different names in the spreadsheets and these entries were filtered out and therefore not considered when string matching was performed(For e.g.: Johannesburg has been entered as City of Johannesburg).  
            
        </p>

        <h4 id="tk">Tkinter</h4>
        <img src="assets/images/research/tkinter.png" alt="" class="large-size-image">
        <p>
          I chose Tkinter as the GUI library to compare with other Python GUIs because it is the standard GUI library included with Python and has been widely used and supported for many years. It is also relatively easy to use and cross-platform compatible.
            <br>
          PyQt and PySide are also popular GUI libraries that use the Qt application framework. They offer a modern appearance and a large number of widgets, but they have a learning curve and can be resource-heavy. Additionally, PyQt has license restrictions that may be a concern for some users.
          <br>
          wxPython is another option that provides a large number of widgets and a modern appearance, but it has a steeper learning curve and less popularity than other libraries.
          <br>
          Ultimately, the choice of GUI library depends on the specific needs and preferences of the developer. Tkinter may be the best choice for those who value simplicity and cross-platform compatibility, while other libraries may be more suitable for those who require more advanced features or a more modern appearance.
        </p>

        <h4 id="tk">PostgreSQL</h4>
        <img src="assets/images/research/sql.png" alt="" class="large-size-image">
        <p>I chose PostgreSQL as the SQL database to compare with other databases because it is a popular open-source relational database management system with a strong reputation for scalability and support for JSON and other data types.
            <br>
            MySQL is another popular open-source database that is easy to use and widely supported, but it has limited JSON support and may require paid licenses for certain features.
            <br>
            Oracle and SQL Server are proprietary databases that offer powerful features and performance, but they require expensive licensing and may be more complex to set up and maintain.
            <br>
            Overall, the choice of database depends on the specific needs and requirements of the project. PostgreSQL may be the best choice for those who require scalability and support for JSON and other data types, while other databases may be more suitable for those who prioritize ease of use, integration with specific technologies, or other features.
